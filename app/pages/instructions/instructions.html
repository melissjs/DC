<b>Morning Set Up:</b> It is important for early morning volunteers to be on time. Check yourself and your other team members in then navigate to the "Morning Check In" procedure in the menu. Fill out the address and precinct number(s) for your polling station then use the geolocator button to identify your location. Upload a photo of the street number of the polling station address.
<br><br>
Introduce yourself to the pollworkers at the polling station. Tell them your team will remain 50’ away from their entrance in accordance with the law (the exact legal length may be different in some states, make sure you or someone else on your team checks). 
<br><br>
Measure 50’ with your tape measure or string. If you didn‘t bring anything to measure with 50’ is about 25 steps on average. Error on the side of being further away than you need to be if you aren‘t sure. Upload a photo of your mark and one with your location in relationship to the entrance of the polling station.
<br><br>
As other volunteers arrive, help them log in to the system with their passcodes and be available to answer their questions if they need help after going through their instructions.

<b>Checking In and Out:</b>
As volunteers come and go, help each other check in and make sure to remind others to remember to check out. It is very important to make sure everyone checks out when they leave and that their database connection is deactivated. If someone leaves for a period of time they can still check back in when they come back, so make sure to check out even for short breaks. 
<br><br>
Shifts have a fifteen minute overlap with each other. This is so that the exiting volunteers have time to teach the incoming volunteers how to sign in, use the app and answer questions (such as where are the nearest bathrooms and electrical outlets? Can they provide any advice for talking to voters? Have there been any anomalies or is there anything specific to watch out for at this location?).

<b>Etiquette:</b>
Please remember to remain impartial to any party or candidate. Our job is not to influence anyone in any way - we are only here to protect the integrity of the true election results. Please make sure your clothes and belongings don’t have promotional messages on them or messages that degrade any party or candidate. Following this ettiquette is essential for protecting the legitmacy of our results and keeping our process viable. 
<br><br>
<b>Interacting with Voters:</b>
Be courteous to voters that are exiting the polling station and have a short statment prepared for explaining that you are here to help them verify their vote. While a high majority of voters will want to participate in the audit, some will not and that is ok, don't feel compelled to try to change anyone's mind and always be polite. 
<br><br>
<b>Tips on Encouraging Participation:</b> During our beta tests we discovered that most people enthusiastically want to participate in the audit, but for those who don't, keep in mind that there are generally two main reasons for this - and they are easy to remedy. 
<br><br>
The first is that people don't want to spend a lot of time being asked to do something unexpected. For this reason, it really helps to lead with a statement telling them how little time this takes. "Would you like to participate in our independent exit audit that will verify the official election results of this polling station? It only takes about three minutes" is a good example of something effective to say. Also, if you get the chance to ask a voter who is entering the station to come back and participate in the audit once they finish voting they will often be more inclined to want to participate because they have had time to think about the audit and why it is important. It is also helpful to lead with a friendly question as voters exit, like "How did it go in there?". This helps people get comfortable talking to you and encourages participation. 
<br><br>
The other main reason people might not be enthusiastic about doing the audit is that they are anxious about disclosing their identifying information. The best way to help someone feel comfortable in that case is to explain to them honestly that their personal information is never linked to their voter record or demographic data. The affidavit page is the only page with identifying information and it is completely abstracted from the other two records and never circulated anywhere outside of the non profit under any circumstance.

<ion-item text-wrap>
<b>Evening Wrap Up:</b>
Once the polling station closes, use the "Evening Wrap Up" menu item to guide you through the evening procedure. Take detailed pictures of the numbers posted on the polling entrance door (this may require a few close up shots). It will be dark outside, so use a flashlight or someone else's cell phone light. Everyone's ability to generate voter reords will be severed at 10:00 PM so it is important to complete the evening wrap up procedures before then (non-voter records and anomaly records will remain available though). You may want to take a screenshot of your activity log before signing out because it may entitle you to perks at neighboring businesses who are honoring your time commitment with special deals. This screenshot is also proof of participation for students receiving extra credit for the audit. Before leaving the location at the end of the night make sure every other volunteer is checked out too. 
<br><br>
In the event there was a long line for your polling station and it closes while people are waiting outside, use the "non-voter record" option in the records menu and continue the audit with the voters who could not vote. This may cause you to have to stay later than intended but it is an extremely effective way to document potential voter suppression and it will be important that volunteers stay if they can.

<b>Voter Record:</b>
If all goes smoothly, voter records are probably what you will spend the majority of your time working on. The process is very simple: greet the voter exiting the polling station and ask them if they would like to participate in the audit. Tell them the audit procedure is very short and easy; their personal information is kept private and their identity is never associated with their vote. They may have questions, so be prepared with answers by reading our FAQ page. When they agree to do the audit you choose the "Add Record" menu item then "Voter Record" or just start from the new voter record screen (every time you complete a record, the app automatically resets to this screen). Follow the three part procedure (affidavit page, vote page and demographics page). If someone changes their mind during the audit and doesn’t want to finish, simply don't save their record and move on to something else in the menu. If they decide not to participate after they have already submitted there is no way to delete the record (this is an intentional feature of the system to mitigate any retroactive malicious activity). Lastly, though not always possible if someone asks questions or for assistance, do your best to give the voter privacy when they are filling out each section.

<b>Non-Voter Record:</b>
Non-voter records are exactly like voter records but specifically for people who were not able to vote. If they were turned away for any reason or not able to get inside on time, these voters intended votes shall still be recorded in our system. This is a very powerful tool for understanding if there is voter suppression or voter disenfranchisement taking place and which candidate(s) it is predominantly effecting.

<ion-item text-wrap>
<b>Amendment Record:</b>
In the event someone chose the wrong candidate and wants to correct that choice, you will need to generate an “Amendment Record”. Choose the wrong candidate they originally selected and then the correct one. This record requires a two party authentication to validate and submit. 
</ion-item>

<ion-item text-wrap>
<b>Anomaly Record:</b>
In the event something unforeseen is taking place at your polling station generate an “Anomaly Record”. Select the kind of anomaly and fill out any applicable fields. An anomaly can be anything you think is important to document. For example, during the primary we needed to document the outrageously high percentage of voters being given provisional ballots. Many voters were eager to create these records because they were understandably upset. These records give the voter the option of including contact information, pictures and video with appropriate permissions in case they are useful for evidence and/or organizing together legal actions.
