<b>Morning Set Up:</b> Check yourself in and fill out the address and precinct number(s) for your polling station. Use the geolocator button to identify your location. Upload a photo of the street number of the polling station address.
<br><br>
Introduce yourself to the volunteers at the polling station. Tell them your team will remain 50’ away from their entrance in accordance with the law.
<br><br>
Measure 50’ with your tape measure or string. If you didn‘t bring anything to measure with 50’ is about 25 steps on average. Error on the side of being further away than you need to be if you aren‘t sure. Upload a photo of your mark and one with your location in relationship to the entrance of the polling station.
<br><br>
As other volunteers arrive, help them log in to the system with their passcodes and be available to answer their questions if they need help after going through the tutorial and their set of instructions. Team leads have access to their team’s list of alpha-numeric passcodes; text each volunteer their specific passcode only if they are physically with you at the polling location.

<b>Throughout the Day:</b>
As volunteers come and go, help them check in and out with their passcodes. It is very important to make sure everyone checks out when they leave and that their passcode is deactivated.

<b>Voter Record Procedure:</b>
If all goes smoothly, voter records are probably what you will spend the majority of your time working on. The process is very simple: greet the voter exiting the polling station and ask them if they would like to participate in the audit. Tell them the audit procedure is very short and easy; their personal information is kept private and their identity is never associated with their vote. They may have questions, here are some answers to commonly asked questions. When they agree to do the audit you either press the “+” sign in the bottom menu then select “voter record” or just start from the new voter record screen (every time you complete a record, the app automatically resets to this screen). Follow the three part procedure. To move on from of part to the next, hit the red check mark on the bottom right. If someone changes their mind during the audit and doesn’t want to finish, hit the trash icon to cancel their record. Though not always possible if someone asks questions or for assistance, do your best to give the voter privacy when they are filling out each section.
