<b>How is personal data kept private?</b>
Personal information is kept private within our databases and is never shared with any outside organization under any circumstance. Additionally, the candidate you voted for is never tied to your identity within the system. The personal data that is collected is only used in the event that our audit uncovers major discrepencies between offical recorded votes and our recorded votes. If this happens and legal action is taken, voters may be contacted to come into court and testify that they voted the same way in our audit as they did within the polling station (you never have to publicly confirm the candidate you voted for, only that you voted the same way). This will prove fraud has taken place within a specific polling station, if it in fact has.

<b>How is oneâ€™s vote kept separate from their personal information?</b>
Your vote is stored in a separate database with no identifying key that tracks back to your identity. The ledger of votes is publicly visable but has no identifying information attached to that data.

<b>Why is it important to have multiple, independent checks on election results?</b>
Elections are essential in a fair and true democracy. When people suspect that politicians are winning elections with fraudulent means, it undermines the entire system and also the respect that the public has for their elected officials. Check and balances from many different, independent sources are ideal for verifying election results because any one solution may be compromised. [Better succinct explanation goes here]
