<b>How is personal data kept private?</b>
Personal information is kept private within our databases and is never shared with any outside organization under any circumstance. Additionally, the candidate you voted for is never tied to your identity within the system. The personal data that is collected is only used in the event that our audit uncovers major discrepencies between offical recorded votes and our recorded votes. If this happens and legal action is taken, in rare cases voters may be contacted to come into court and testify that they voted the same way in our audit as they did within the polling station (no one ever has to publicly confirm the candidate they voted for, only that they voted the same way). This will prove fraud has taken place within a specific polling station, if it in fact has.

<b>How is oneâ€™s vote kept separate from their personal information?</b>
Personal information is stored in a separate data structure with no identifying key that tracks back to one's identity. The ledger of votes is accessable publicly but there is no identifying information attached to that data.

<b>How are the election audit results protected from corruption?</b>
We want our mobile software and the accompanying web application to be completely open source; we are committed to transparency within our system. However, for the 2016 general election, our system will be closed source due to time constraints that could undermine security. Our source will be opened to the courts and public immediatly after the election though, in the event that we proceed with any legal action(s). Our data will be redundantly stored and monitored on election day and each team independently verifies their own end of the day totals. This enables us to obtain another layer of accountability because we will be able to account for every vote based on the confirmations of team verified counts. In the future we will institute block chain technology that has the potential to virtually eliminate the already dimished hazard of hacking.

<b>Why is it important to have multiple, independent checks on election results?</b>
Elections are essential in a fair and true democracy. When people suspect that politicians are winning elections with fraudulent means, it undermines the entire system and also the respect that the public has for their elected officials. Check and balances from many different, independent sources are ideal for verifying election results because any one solution may be compromised.

<b>Is Democracy Counts a nonprofit?</b>
We are working under the legal umbrella of Sunrise Centera, a 501(C)(3), so contributions are tax deductible. We will have our own 501(C)(3) status in the near future.

<b>Do we pay auditors?</b>
We don't have funding for paying auditors but we will do our absolute best to provide volunteers with small travel and parking stipends if they request it. We don't know how successful our fundraising effort will be yet but we appreciate every single volunteer who is taking time to help make this effort a success and want to make sure we support them if we have the ability to.

<b>Is Democracy Counts nonpartisian?</b>
Yes. We are completely unaffiliated with any party and we want to collaborate with volunteers that support a diverse range of parties and policies. We are not invested in who wins elections, only that the winners actually legitimately won.
